								<p>Welcome to the GWizards System! There are a number of things you can do. For a Student user you may view the projects in the system and you may also see the projects you're assigned to. </p>
								<br>
								<p>Staff are able to create projects and category tags. Once they have been approved they will be live on the system. You are also able to attach useful documents to your projects for your students.</p>
